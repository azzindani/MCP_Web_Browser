"""Answer a rejected ARGUMENT with the return contract, not a pydantic dump.

Every tool here promises the same failure shape: `success: False`, `op`,
`error`, `hint`, `token_estimate`. That promise held for everything the tool
body could raise -- and broke completely one step earlier. An argument of the
wrong *type* is rejected by pydantic before a single line of our code runs:

    fs_read(path=123)
      -> 1 validation error for call[fs_read]
         path
           Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, ...]
             For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.12/v/string_type

No `success` to branch on, no `error`, no `hint` to act on, no
`token_estimate` to budget with -- and an external URL, in a fleet whose
founding constraint is that it works offline and nothing leaves the machine.

Confirmed on all four servers. `enforce_known_arguments` looks like it covers
this and does not: it catches an unknown argument NAME, while a known name with
the wrong type never reaches it. A guard that appears to cover a case it misses
is worse than no guard, because nobody looks again.

Round 18 could not see this at all. Its axis was "do what the hint told you to
do", and here there is no hint to follow -- the phase records a tool that failed
without advice and moves on. It was found by chasing a one-line aside in a
report ("also tried row_index='two', got validation error without hint").

Wrapping `call_tool` is the same choke point `enforce_known_arguments` uses, so
one install per server covers every tool it has, including any added later.

The two FastMCP flavours in this fleet differ in ways that matter here, which is
why the wrapper takes *args and inspects rather than declaring parameters:

    bundled mcp.server.fastmcp   call_tool(name, arguments, context, convert_result)
                                 raises ToolError wrapping the pydantic text
    fastmcp 2.x                  call_tool(key, arguments)
                                 raises pydantic ValidationError, returns ToolResult
