"""remote_smoke_test.sh must exercise every tool this repo defines.

The smoke test is the only thing that calls these tools the way a client does --
over HTTP, through auth, against the deployed server. pytest deliberately never
does (CLAUDE.md, "Remote smoke tests"), so a tool missing from that script is a
tool nothing end-to-end has ever run.

Nothing used to check the two stayed in step. That is not hypothetical: a
coverage sweep driven through a harness was told to call "every tool the
filesystem server exposes (list them first, then call each)" for two of the
servers, and it listed some and called none -- 19 tools silently unexercised,
with the run still reporting a clean pass because it only reported on what it
had chosen to call. The same drift can happen here the moment someone adds a
tool and forgets the script.

This runs offline: the tool list comes from the AST of the server modules, not
from a running server, so it works in CI with no network and no container.
