"""Every tool this repo registers must appear in the README.

Cutting this release meant counting the tools by hand, and the README was wrong
in four repos at once: Data_Analyst said 71 and had 72, Office said 98 and had
99, File_System said 6 and had 7, and Web_Browser's total was right while its
per-tier breakdown was wrong twice in ways that cancelled out. Each README was
written true and went stale the moment a tool was added, because nothing was
checking.

The check is deliberately a source scan rather than an import: it needs no
server to start and no optional dependency installed, and it sees the tools
where they are declared. A tool missing from the README is a tool a caller
cannot discover without calling `tools/list` and guessing.
